Description: The International Aid Transparency Initiatives (IATI) is a global 
    aid transparency standard and it makes information about aid spending easier 
    to access, use and understand using a unified open standard. Openaid IATI
    Parser and Application Programming Interface (OIPA) enables IATI standard 
    compliant dadtasets to easily parse and interface that data using API that
    has been developed on the Django framework. This package provides an R
    interface to the OIPA.
